# Getting Started with React in 2025

React has evolved significantly over the years, and 2025 brings even more exciting features and best practices to the table.

## Why React?

React remains one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. Here's why:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates and rendering
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Thousands of libraries and tools
- **Strong Community**: Extensive resources and support

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into React, you'll need to set up your development environment properly.

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. A code editor (VS Code recommended)
3. Basic JavaScript knowledge

### Creating Your First App

Use Vite for the fastest development experience:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Core Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

### State and Props

- **Props**: Pass data from parent to child components
- **State**: Manage component-specific data that changes over time

### Hooks

Modern React uses hooks for state management and side effects:

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- Custom hooks

## Best Practices

1. Keep components small and focused
2. Use TypeScript for better type safety
3. Follow the single responsibility principle
4. Write meaningful component names

## Conclusion

React in 2025 is more powerful and developer-friendly than ever. Start building, keep learning, and enjoy the journey!
